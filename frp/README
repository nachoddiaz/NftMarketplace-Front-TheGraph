Here would have two files if Moralis v1 was still active:
frpc -> exec
frpc.ini -> config files


After that, we come to this folder and we run the next commands
on the terminal: ./frpc -c frpc.ini
To link our hardhat blockchain to our Moralis server


Other way would be interact with the Moralis admin cli
 - 1.yarn global add moralis-admin-cli
 - 2.edit jackage.son with:
  "moralis:sync": "moralis-admin-cli connect-local-devchain --chain hardhat --moralisSubdomain + "OuMoralisServerUrl" --frpcPath ./frp/frpc"
 - 3. Add moralisApiKey & moralisApisecret to .env
